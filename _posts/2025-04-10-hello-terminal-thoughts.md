Welcome to **Terminal Thoughts**, my new dev blog!

This is where I’ll be dropping insights from my coding journey, building personal projects, exploring new tech, and occasionally just writing to think.

I’ve been building in the background for a while, and I wanted a simple, fun, and clean way to share what I’m learning, what I’m building, and what I’m thinking about.

Expect:
- Short dev notes
- Tutorials and guides
- Project logs
- Random terminal musings ☕

Let’s see where this goes. Thanks for reading!

Stay curious.

— Phillip

Technical interviews can feel intimidating — algorithms, whiteboards, system design, pressure. But with preparation, strategy, and confidence, you can navigate them like a pro.

This guide covers what to expect, how to prepare, and how to perform your best.

## 📚 What to Expect

- **Coding Challenges** (Leetcode-style problems)
- **System Design** (for experienced roles)
- **Behavioral Questions** (“Tell me about a time…”)
- **Take-Home Projects** (Build something on your own time)
- **Live Pair Programming** (You code while someone watches or collaborates)

## 🛠️ How to Prepare

### 1. Brush Up on Core Concepts
- Data structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps
- Algorithms: Sorting, recursion, binary search, tree traversal
- Big O notation basics

### 2. Practice Problems
- Sites like Leetcode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, and Codewars
- Focus on patterns, not memorization

### 3. Mock Interviews
- Practice with a friend or use tools like Pramp or Interviewing.io
- Get comfortable thinking out loud

### 4. Behavioral Preparation
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Prepare answers to common prompts:
  - “Tell me about yourself”
  - “Describe a time you overcame a challenge”
  - “What’s a mistake you made and what did you learn?”

### 5. Review Past Projects
- Be ready to explain your role, decisions made, challenges faced
- Know your code well enough to walk through it confidently

## 🧠 Mindset Tips

- Take your time — interviewers care more about your process than speed
- If you get stuck, talk through your thoughts and ask clarifying questions
- Don’t fake it — honesty and problem-solving matter more than perfection
- It’s okay to not know everything

## 💡 Interview Day Reminders

- Get sleep the night before
- Test your tech setup if it’s remote
- Keep a notepad nearby for sketching ideas
- Breathe. You got this.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

Interviews are a skill — and like any skill, you can get better with practice.

Stay consistent, prepare smart, and keep showing up. You’re learning every step of the way.

One of the most underrated dev skills isn't in your code — it's in your calendar.

Consistency. Showing up. Sticking with it.

There were seasons where I felt stuck. Times I didn’t think I was making progress. Days where imposter syndrome hit harder than any bug ever could. But the one thing I tried to stay committed to? Showing up.

Here’s what I’ve learned from staying consistent:

---

### 🛠 1. Tiny Steps Add Up
Even 15–30 minutes a day compounds. Some nights it’s a full tutorial binge. Other nights, it’s just reading docs or sketching ideas. That’s still forward motion. It’s easy to discount the days where you didn’t “do much,” but over time those moments are the ones that build real momentum.

### 🧠 2. You Learn By Doing (and Repeating)
You don't learn to code by reading — you learn by doing, breaking things, and repeating it until it sticks. Repetition rewires your brain and makes the once-unfamiliar feel like second nature. It’s not about being perfect — it’s about being persistent.

### 🚫 3. Breaks Are Part of the Process
Consistency doesn’t mean burnout. There’s value in rest. I’ve stepped away for a few days before — and came back sharper. Sometimes, a reset gives you the clarity to see a problem from a fresh angle, or the inspiration to try a new solution.

### 💬 4. Talk About It
Blog posts, journaling, tweets, conversations — sharing what I’ve learned makes it stick, and sometimes even helps someone else. Writing it out forces you to process your thoughts, and teaching it to others is one of the best ways to reinforce what you know.

There’s no magic formula. Just keep showing up. One line, one commit, one post at a time.

Stay steady, stay sharp ✨

And if you're reading this wondering if it’s worth continuing — it is. Keep going. Your future self will thank you.

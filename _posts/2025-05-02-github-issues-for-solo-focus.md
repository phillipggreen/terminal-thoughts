When you're working solo, staying organized is 90% of the battle. It’s too easy to bounce between features, forget half-finished fixes, or stall out because you don’t know what to work on next.

That’s why I started using **GitHub Issues** — not just for bugs, but for *everything*. Here's how I use it to keep my solo projects on track without needing a fancy task manager.

## 🗂️ One Issue = One Focus

Each issue becomes a single piece of work:

- A bug I spotted
- A feature idea
- A content update
- A research topic (like “learn how to integrate Supabase”)

That way, I never open my repo and think “uhh what was I doing?” — I just look at the open issues.

## 🧠 Labels Make It Click

I use a few lightweight labels:

- `feature`
- `bug`
- `idea`
- `writing`
- `priority`

They’re color-coded, easy to filter, and help me jump into a specific mode when I sit down to work.

## ✅ Use Checklists Inside Issues

For more complex tasks, I include a checklist:

```markdown
- [ ] Set up database
- [ ] Create auth flow
- [ ] Build dashboard layout
```

This keeps momentum flowing inside a single context — and checking things off feels great.

## 🔁 Closed Issues = Progress History

Closing issues gives me a lightweight changelog. I can go back and see how far I’ve come — even if the project feels slow.

## 🔒 Private Repos? Still Works

If you're not ready to open source something, the system still works inside a private repo. You don’t need followers to benefit from structure.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

You don’t need a full-blown project management tool to stay on track. GitHub Issues is already there — and if you use it intentionally, it’s one of the best solo dev companions out there.

Keep it simple. Keep shipping.

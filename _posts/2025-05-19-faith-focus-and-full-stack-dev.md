I never saw faith and coding as things that belonged together.

For years, they felt like separate lanes.  
My faith was private — a part of my personal life.  
My code was public — projects, GitHub, client work, career goals.

But somewhere along the way, I stopped trying to split them.

Now? They support each other.  
One shapes how I show up in the other.

## 🧠 Faith Fuels My Focus

Being a developer means dealing with complexity every day:

- Bugs that don’t make sense
- Deadlines that creep in
- Impostor syndrome knocking on the door
- The constant tension between “I’m not ready” and “I have to ship this”

In those moments, I’ve learned to pause.

> Sometimes it’s a deep breath.  
> Sometimes it’s a prayer.  
> Sometimes it’s opening my Bible app instead of yet another dev tutorial.

That moment of stillness reminds me:

- I’m not alone in this work.
- My identity isn’t tied to how perfect my code is.
- The pressure I feel isn’t always truth — it’s noise I can filter out.

That’s not just spiritual. It’s strategic.

## 📱 The *Called* Project

Building my *Called* app was a turning point.

I didn’t create it to go viral or monetize anything.  
I made it because I needed it.

A clean, minimal way to:

- Read the Bible verse-by-verse
- Reflect as I go
- Keep a personal journal tied to the text
- Build a tool for spiritual discipline the same way I build tools for work

Now, every time I write a new feature or debug a small bug in *Called*, it reminds me why I started coding in the first place:  
**To create things that matter.**

## 🛠 Faith Shapes the Way I Build

- I don’t chase hype stacks — I chase stability.
- I don’t want to be the smartest — I want to be steady, teachable, and trustworthy.
- I measure success in impact, not just engagement.

That mindset shift changes how I approach:

- Client relationships
- Open source contributions
- Time with family vs. time in front of a screen

Because when you’re building with purpose, you start making different trade-offs.

## ✨ Grace Over Grind

Tech culture can be loud.  
“Ship faster. Learn more. Build bigger.”  
And don’t get me wrong — I love a good dev sprint.

But I’m learning to operate from **rest**, not just hustle.

> I can still move fast — but I don’t have to *prove* myself every day.  
> I can keep growing — but I don’t need to know it all right now.  
> I can do good work — and still take a Sabbath.

Faith doesn’t make me less driven.  
It just reminds me *why* I’m driven.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

You don’t have to keep faith and code in separate folders.

Let your values shape your velocity.  
Let your purpose guide your productivity.  
Let your dev life reflect who you are — not just what you know.

*If you’re walking this path too — juggling tech, faith, life, and purpose — I’d love to connect. You’re not alone out here.*

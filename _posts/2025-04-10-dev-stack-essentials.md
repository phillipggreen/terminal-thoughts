Every developer has a toolkit — and while mine evolves as I learn and experiment, a few staples have stuck around. Here's what I'm using right now and why.

### 💻 Editor: VS Code
I’ve tried others, but VS Code just *gets it*. It's fast, flexible, and has a vibrant ecosystem. Bonus: I use my own custom [**CyberDev Theme**](https://github.com/phillipggreen/cyberdev-vscode) to keep things feeling sharp and futuristic.

### 🌐 Terminal: Windows Terminal + WSL
WSL2 gives me the flexibility of a Linux development environment inside Windows, which makes working with Git, Node, and Docker seamless.

### 🗃️ Version Control: Git + GitHub
I commit like I breathe. GitHub isn’t just storage — it’s my archive, my progress tracker, and my connection to the dev world.

### 🔨 Frameworks & Tools
- **Jekyll + Chirpy** → This blog
- **React** → For frontend apps and fun UI ideas
- **Node.js** → For backend experiments and quick scripts
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL** → Depending on the project needs

### 🧠 Why This Stack?
Everything I use is chosen for speed, simplicity, and staying focused. I don’t want to fight my tools — I want them to help me get in the zone.

This stack will grow and change, but for now? It’s smooth, productive, and mine.

Sometimes when I'm debugging late at night, I like to imagine my codebase as a Pokémon team — each part with its own personality, strengths, and quirks. Here’s what my current lineup looks like:

## 🧠 1. `main.js` — Alakazam  
Psychic-type, always thinking ahead, super fast but a little fragile. Handles logic and complexity like a champ.

## 🔁 2. `utils.js` — Ditto  
Shapeshifter. Can be anything you need it to be. Sometimes overused. Definitely underestimated.

## 💥 3. `errors.log` — Exploud  
Loud, chaotic, always shouting. Keeps track of everything that went wrong — and never lets you forget it.

## 🧱 4. `components/` — Onix  
Big, solid, and responsible for holding the structure together. Sometimes bulky, but dependable.

## 🔐 5. `auth.js` — Gengar  
A little sneaky, very clever, and knows how to vanish. Keeps things secure... mostly.

## 🔧 6. `README.md` — Chansey  
Supportive, full of kindness, and always there to help. Doesn't do the heavy lifting, but everyone benefits when it's around.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

Your codebase might not evolve like a Pokémon team, but it definitely has its types, roles, and MVPs. The fun part? You’re the trainer. You get to shape the team, level it up, and figure out what works best together.

So... what’s in your party?

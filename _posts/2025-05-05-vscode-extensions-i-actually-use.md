Let’s be honest — it’s easy to go extension-wild in VS Code. I’ve installed (and uninstalled) more than I can count. But after years of trial and error, these are the ones that have stuck with me — the ones I rely on *every day* to stay focused, productive, and in flow.

## 🎨 CyberDev Theme (by me!)

Let’s start with the look and feel. I built my own custom VS Code theme: [**CyberDev**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PhillipGreen.cyberdev) — a neon-drenched, cyberpunk-inspired color palette that keeps my workspace feeling sharp and futuristic.

## ⚙️ Productivity & Formatting

- **Auto Rename Tag**: Saves time when editing HTML or JSX. Rename one tag — the matching one updates instantly.
- **Prettier – Code Formatter**: Keeps my code clean and consistent, especially in team or shared repos.
- **markdownlint**: Makes writing blog posts and docs cleaner. It’s like spellcheck, but for Markdown.

## 👨‍💻 Language Support & Dev Tools

- **C/C++** + **Extension Pack + Themes**: For all my lower-level work and school assignments.
- **Pylance**, **Python**, **Python Debugger**: My go-to stack for scripting and automation.
- **C#**, **.NET Install Tool**, **C# Dev Kit**: For occasional backend work or desktop experiments.

## 🐳 Containers & Web Dev

- **Docker** & **Dev Containers**: I like the flexibility of spinning up isolated environments for projects.
- **Live Server** & **Live Preview**: Perfect for fast feedback when working on front-end experiments.
- **ESLint**: Keeps my JavaScript and React projects from getting messy.
- **PHP Debug**: Occasionally useful when working with legacy systems or client sites.

## 🤖 AI and Integrations

- **GitHub Copilot + Copilot Chat**: Super helpful for brainstorming code, especially when I’m stuck or exploring something new.
- **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues**: I use GitHub to track solo dev progress, so this extension helps bridge the workflow directly into VS Code.

I keep my VS Code setup lean and useful — every extension has a purpose, and I try not to install anything I won’t actually use. The key is to build an environment that *feels like yours* and doesn’t slow you down.

Got a must-have extension I should try? Let me know — I’m always curious.

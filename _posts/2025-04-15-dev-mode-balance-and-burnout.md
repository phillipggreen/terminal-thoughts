When you're learning to code, building projects, raising kids, working full-time, freelancing — or doing all of those at once — it's easy to lose yourself in "dev mode." You know the one: when you're grinding, focused, and pushing through every day like you're in a sprint that never ends.

But here’s the truth: if you don’t find balance, you will burn out.

This post is a reminder — mostly to myself — that *rest is part of the process*.

## 🚧 Recognizing the Signs of Burnout

- You're irritable or exhausted before you even start working
- You can't remember the last time you coded just for fun
- You dread opening your laptop (but do it anyway)
- You feel like no matter what you finish, you're still behind

Sound familiar? You're not broken — you're human.

## 🧘 How I'm Learning to Balance

### 1. **Creating Clear Shutdown Times**
I give myself a daily cutoff: after a certain time, I’m done. No more tutorials, no late-night “just one more bug fix.”

### 2. **Blocking Time for Family**
Coding is a passion — but it’s not more important than the people I love. I put time with my wife and kids on the calendar *first*.

### 3. **Taking Screenless Breaks**
A walk. A book. A deep breath. Something that doesn’t involve a glowing rectangle.

### 4. **Saying No to Everything for a Day**
Every so often, I take a full day off from tech. No learning. No building. Just being. It always makes me better when I come back.

### 5. **Letting Myself Be Unproductive**
Not every hour needs to be optimized. Rest isn't wasted time — it's required maintenance.

## 🧠 Reframing Productivity

You don’t have to earn rest.
You don’t have to “finish everything” before you take a break.
You don’t need to constantly compare your output to someone else's.

Your pace is your power.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

You can love this field and still take time off.
You can build incredible things without burning out.
You can be a great developer *and* a great human.

So here's your reminder (and mine):
- Drink some water 💧
- Take a walk 🚶‍♂️
- Get some sleep 🛏️
- Your code will still be there tomorrow 🧠

*What helps you rest or reset when you're deep in the dev grind? I'd love to hear it.*

Being a dev has taught me a lot about patience, problem-solving, and persistence.

But if I’m being honest?  
Parenting has taught me those things *faster*.

Raising two kids while building code has created this strange (and beautiful) overlap — moments where I realize the exact same lessons apply, just in different contexts.

Some of my best dev habits?  
Rooted in being a dad.

## 🧠 Lesson 1: Curiosity Wins

My kids ask questions constantly:

- “What happens if I press this?”
- “Why does the moon follow our car?”
- “Can I build a robot that makes grilled cheese?”

They aren’t worried about “looking dumb.”  
They’re wired to *wonder*.

That same attitude makes for better developers.  
The best coders I know ask questions without shame.  
They break things just to see what happens.  
They learn by doing, not by fearing failure.

And I’m learning to bring that mindset to the terminal too.

## 🧱 Lesson 2: Progress Looks Messy

When my kids are learning something new — tying shoes, writing letters, riding a bike — it’s not smooth. It’s clumsy. It’s slow. It’s repetitive.

And yet, they don’t quit.  
They just keep trying, falling, and adjusting.

That reminds me of how I felt learning React. Or how I *still* feel every time I try something new in Spring Boot.

Real progress is rarely elegant in the moment.  
It’s awkward. It’s trial-and-error.  
And that’s okay.

## 💡 Lesson 3: Celebrate Small Wins

When my son finishes a LEGO build or solves a puzzle, he beams.  
Not because it’s perfect — but because *he did it*.

That joy? I try to carry it into dev life.

- Finished refactoring? Celebrate.  
- Pushed a feature live? Celebrate.  
- Solved a bug you’ve been stuck on for two hours? CELEBRATE.

Because this work is hard.  
And if we don’t take time to celebrate small wins, we’ll burn out chasing the big ones.

## ❤️ Lesson 4: Love First, Correct Second

As a parent, I’ve learned not every mistake needs a lecture.  
Sometimes they just need presence, patience, and grace.

I’ve started applying that to code too — especially when reviewing PRs, working with clients, or even revisiting my own “bad” code from a few months ago.

Lead with compassion. Then critique.

And when you're dealing with *yourself* — that same rule applies.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

I never expected parenting to make me a better developer.

But it has:

- It’s made me slower to judge and quicker to try again.
- It’s taught me to explain things clearly.
- It’s reminded me that joy, wonder, and play belong in learning — at any age.

So whether I’m debugging state or breaking up sibling fights, one thing stays true:

> We’re all learning.  
We all need grace.  
And the journey’s better when we walk it with curiosity, creativity, and love.

*What’s a life lesson that’s shaped how you approach code? I’d love to hear it.*

I remember the exact moment I almost quit.

A simple bug had turned into hours of frustration. I couldn’t get it to work, and every “solution” I found online either didn’t apply or made it worse. I sat there, hands off the keyboard, wondering if I just wasn’t cut out for this.

That moment — when quitting felt easier than trying again — taught me something deeper about the developer journey.

## 🧠 Coding Isn't Just Logical — It's Emotional

Yes, code is made of logic. But learning to code? That’s emotional. It messes with your confidence. It brings out your inner critic. It pushes every perfectionist button.

## 🧩 The Real Problem Wasn’t the Bug

The real issue was how I *felt* about not solving it fast enough.
I wasn’t just stuck — I was ashamed of being stuck.
I thought it meant I wasn’t good enough.

But then I took a breath. I stepped away. I came back the next morning — and I fixed it in 15 minutes.

## 🔁 Patterns I Recognize Now

- That wasn’t my last moment of doubt. But now I know: doubt is a signal, not a stop sign.
- Taking breaks is productive.
- Asking for help isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom.
- Most of the people I admire in tech have been through the same thing.

## 💬 What Keeps Me Going

- I remember *why* I started.
- I focus on *progress*, not perfection.
- I surround myself with community and encouragement.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

If you're in that same place — stuck, doubting, ready to give up — you're not alone. We've all been there. And I promise, you're not failing.

You're just learning.

Keep going.

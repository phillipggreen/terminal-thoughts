I used to think rest was something you earned.

Like it came *after* the checklist.  
After the feature shipped.  
After the bugs were fixed, the inbox was zeroed, and the repo was clean.

But over the last year â€” through long weeks, heavy projects, family moments I didnâ€™t want to miss, and more than a few 11PM coding sprints â€” Iâ€™ve learned something else:

> **Rest isnâ€™t a reward.  
Itâ€™s a requirement.**

## ðŸ›  Coding Isnâ€™t Just Keys and Logic

Itâ€™s emotional.  
Itâ€™s mental.  
Itâ€™s creative.

Which means your mind is the core engine behind your work â€” and engines need maintenance.

When I try to grind without margin, I write messier code. I forget things. I get stuck in dumb bugs that would be obvious if I just walked away for 20 minutes.

But when I step back â€” take a walk, play with my kids, read a verse, or just breathe â€” I come back sharper.

## ðŸš¨ The Signs Iâ€™ve Learned to Watch For

You donâ€™t always realize youâ€™re burning out *until* you do.  
Hereâ€™s how it shows up for me:

- I start avoiding the work I normally enjoy.
- Every task feels heavier than it should.
- I keep switching tabs or tools without finishing anything.
- Iâ€™m easily frustrated â€” with code, with people, with myself.

Thatâ€™s not laziness.  
Thatâ€™s a low battery warning.

## ðŸ’¡ Rest Isnâ€™t the Opposite of Work â€” Itâ€™s Part of It

Think about it like this:

- **Developers need breaks.** Even CPUs have cooling systems.
- **Projects need pauses.** Even agile sprints have retros.
- **Lives need rhythm.** Even the best code is written in silence between the keystrokes.

So Iâ€™ve started building rest into my workflow â€” like versioning for my brain.

- Morning weights to reset my head.
- Tech-free evenings with my wife and kids.
- Saturdays with *no goals*, just family and faith.
- Prayer, journaling, music, or sometimes just silence.

Itâ€™s not a sign of slacking.  
Itâ€™s a strategy for sustainability.

## ðŸ§µ Wrapping Up

You donâ€™t have to earn rest.  
You just need it.

If youâ€™ve been running nonstop â€” take this as your reminder to breathe.

- Close the laptop early.
- Stretch your legs.
- Let your mind wander.
- Trust that the work will wait â€” and youâ€™ll be better for it.

Because rest isnâ€™t time *away* from the work.

Itâ€™s what makes the work *possible*.

*How do you reset when the dev grind gets too loud? Iâ€™d love to hear your rhythm.*

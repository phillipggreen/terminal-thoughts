I didn’t mean to disappear from the blog.

When I started *Terminal Thoughts*, I told myself I’d post every weekday. Not out of obligation — but because writing helped me process the dev grind, stay grounded, and track my growth in public. 

And for a while, I stuck with it.  
Until I didn’t.

## 🧠 Life Happens (And That’s Okay)

The truth is, I got busy — with real, meaningful things.  
- I was pushing code.  
- Reworking features.  
- Learning backend frameworks.  
- Writing documentation.  
- Helping my kids with homeschool.  
- Supporting my wife’s goals.  
- Showing up for my family, my faith, and myself.

And somewhere in the middle of it all, blogging quietly slipped out of frame.

I used to think stepping away from something meant I failed it.  
But now I think it just means I trusted myself to come back when I was ready.

## 🛠 Blogging Is a Tool, Not a Task

When I treat it like a streak to protect, it feels like pressure.  
When I treat it like a journal for my developer brain — it becomes a place I *want* to return to.

This blog was never about going viral. It’s about showing up, being real, and writing things I wish existed when I was starting out.

So yeah — I took a break.  
But I wasn’t standing still.

## 🔁 How I Know I’m Ready Again

- I missed writing. Not just typing — *reflecting*.  
- I kept thinking, “I should share this,” after a bug fix or new project insight.  
- I started writing blog posts in my head again — always a good sign.  

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

If you’ve been quiet on something you care about — a blog, a project, a habit — don’t let guilt stop you from picking it back up.

Rest doesn’t erase momentum.  
Silence doesn’t mean failure.  
And restarting isn’t weak — it’s brave.

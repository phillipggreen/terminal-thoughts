## 📅 April 16 – May 1: Real Life > Perfect Streaks

It’s been a minute since I posted — April 16, to be exact. Not because I’ve run out of things to say, but because life got real, fast.

And if I’ve learned anything on this journey, it’s this: **growth doesn’t always show up in a GitHub graph** or a blog streak. Sometimes it shows up in quiet progress, deep breaths, and small pivots that no one sees but you.

### 🧠 Where My Energy Went

- **🖥️ Rebuilt My Dev Environment:** ShadowNet is live. Wiped my PC, set up a clean slate, reinstalled the essentials. It was a hassle — but also oddly refreshing. Like digital spring cleaning for the mind.
  
- **🔧 Continued My Workflow Automation:** I kept improving my SharePoint/Power Automate flows for QA processes at work. These aren’t the kind of things that get claps online — but they make a real difference. And that matters.

- **📚 Studying + Learning in Motion:** I’ve been juggling CHE 104L and Operating Systems, but what’s stuck with me most is the project-over-tutorial mindset. I’m leaning into building over consuming — learning by doing, not just watching.

- **💪 Gym at Sunrise:** I’m back to lifting weights before the world wakes up. It’s grounding. It’s hard. But it’s mine. Every rep clears a little more mental fog.

- **📖 Spiritual Growth:** I’ve continued my Bible study — just finished *Joshua*, starting *Judges*. I’m learning to trust more, strive less, and lead better — in tech and in life.

- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Time:** I’ve blocked off more time for my wife and kids. We’ve laughed, fought screen time battles, talked about dreams, and just existed together. That’s real wealth.

### 💬 Reflections That Hit Me This Week

- Rest is productive.
- Your dev journey is still valid even if you step away for a few days.
- You don’t need to document everything — but when you do, it helps you see how far you’ve come.
- Sometimes progress is invisible — but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

### 🔁 Moving Forward

I’m not going to chase perfection here. No daily post pressure. Just honest thoughts, as often as I can. This page is for me — and for anyone else trying to code, create, grow, and live a meaningful life in the middle of the mess.

So here’s my reset. My reentry. My recommitment.

Let’s keep building — one command, one project, one lesson at a time.

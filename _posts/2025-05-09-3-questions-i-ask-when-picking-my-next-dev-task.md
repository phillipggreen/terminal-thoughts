When I stop posting for a while, itâ€™s not because Iâ€™ve lost interest.

Itâ€™s usually the opposite â€” Iâ€™ve gotten *so* deep into something that I lose track of everything else.

This week, I finally came up for air long enough to realize how much Iâ€™ve been building in the background. Itâ€™s messy. Itâ€™s experimental. Itâ€™s not always ready for show-and-tell.

But itâ€™s mine.  
And itâ€™s moving forward.

## ðŸ’¡ Project 1: The PokÃ©mon Companion App

This oneâ€™s been a passion project from the jump. Iâ€™ve always loved games that mix exploration with strategy, and PokÃ©mon has been that constant for me â€” as a player, a dad, and now a dev.

I wanted to build something *useful*, not just another static PokÃ©dex. So far, Iâ€™ve wired up:

- âœ… Team builder with shiny toggle
- âœ… PokÃ©mon search and filtering
- âœ… LocalStorage saves
- âœ… A clean, mobile-friendly UI in React + Tailwind
- âœ… Plans for battle simulation, stat comparisons, and favorites

Itâ€™s taught me more about state management, local storage patterns, and scalable component design than any course could.  
Not to mention â€” debugging evolution chains is its own kind of logic puzzle.

## ðŸ“– Project 2: My Bible App (Called)

This oneâ€™s personal.

I started building *Called* as a faith-forward web app that lets me journal verse by verse as I read. I wanted something minimal, scripture-focused, and useful for real spiritual growth â€” not just another Bible app with ads and features Iâ€™d never use.

So far it has:

- âœ… React + Spring Boot full-stack setup
- âœ… Verse-by-verse viewing
- âœ… Journaling per book and chapter
- âœ… Clean Tailwind UI
- âœ… Plans for saved journal history and offline mode

This one matters to me on a different level â€” and itâ€™s helping me learn to treat faith and code not as separate lives, but as threads of the same journey.

## ðŸ’¼ Project 3: Client Work + Green Digital

Between all that, Iâ€™ve been:

- Wrapping up SEO work for a local business
- Writing clean FAQs for a new clothing brand
- Helping family with social presence and web setup
- Refining the GDS brand and planning out bundled services

This isnâ€™t the kind of work that ends up in a flashy GitHub repo â€” but it *does* pay off. Iâ€™ve learned how to write client-safe copy, build fast with drag-and-drop platforms like Wix, and prioritize clarity over cleverness.

Not to mention, itâ€™s taught me how to juggle meetings, expectations, edits, and deadlines.  
Real developer stuff â€” just with less code and more communication.

## ðŸ§µ Wrapping Up

Not everything I build is visible.

Not every project makes it to Twitter or GitHub the moment it's functional. Some things live in draft folders, in test branches, in local environments that only I see â€” for now.

But they matter.

They shape my workflow.  
They sharpen my skills.  
They remind me *why* I build at all.

So if youâ€™re building something behind the scenes â€” even if no one sees it yet â€” keep going.  
Your future self (and maybe your future users) will thank you.

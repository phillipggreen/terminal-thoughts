If you've ever finished a course, closed the tab, and instantly forgotten everything you just "learned" — welcome to tutorial hell.

I lived there for a while.

And it wasn’t until I started building things *before* I felt ready that I truly started learning.

## 📺 What is Tutorial Hell?

Tutorial hell is when you consume tons of coding content — YouTube, Udemy, blog posts — but never build anything on your own. You feel productive, but you're not applying what you're learning.

I didn’t feel confident enough to start a project… so I kept watching.

But the confidence never came — until I *stopped watching* and *started building*.

## 🔄 What Changed

I picked a project I cared about. Something small but real.
I Googled constantly.
I messed up.
I rewrote code.
I learned.

I started to *own* my learning.

## 💡 Benefits of Project-First Learning

- You get comfortable being uncomfortable
- You remember things because you struggled with them
- You learn *just enough* to move forward
- You build a portfolio naturally
- You see real results — and that builds confidence

## 🔁 My Current Strategy

1. Pick something I want to build
2. Sketch it out (literally or mentally)
3. Use tutorials *as references*, not scripts
4. Keep track of problems I hit and how I solved them
5. Repeat with a slightly harder project

## 🧠 When I Still Use Tutorials

Tutorials aren't bad. They’re just tools — and tools work best when you know what you’re trying to build.

I use them:
- To learn new libraries (e.g., Tailwind, Prisma)
- For syntax refreshers or setup walkthroughs
- To see how others approach a concept I already tried on my own

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

Tutorials can help — but they won’t teach you everything. The real growth happens when you struggle through something you care about.

So if you’re stuck in tutorial hell — start a project. It doesn’t have to be perfect.
It just has to be yours.

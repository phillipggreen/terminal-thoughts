I love a good Stack Overflow thread.  
Google has saved me from dozens of obscure bugs and forgotten syntax over the years.

But every once in a while, something strange happens.

I run into a bug, pause before opening a tab, and think,  
> *“Wait... I think I can figure this out.”*

And when I do?  
That bug becomes a turning point.

## 🧠 What Happens When You Debug Without Google

You engage differently.

You stop hunting for someone else’s answer and start asking *better questions*:

- What just changed?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What’s the code actually doing — not what I think it’s doing?

You open the debugger.  
You walk through the logic line by line.  
You log variables, inspect state, test conditions.

And somewhere in that process… it clicks.

That’s not just a fix. That’s a **lesson that sticks**.

## 🔍 My Most Recent Example

I was working on a small UI update for my Pokémon app. One dropdown wasn’t displaying the right options when the team state updated.

My first instinct?  
“Google it. It’s probably a React thing.”

But I didn’t.

Instead, I sat back, cracked my knuckles, and dug in:

- Checked the state shape
- Logged the rendering logic
- Walked through the `useEffect` triggers
- Found the missing dependency: I’d been updating one piece of state, but forgetting to recalculate the derived list.

Fixed it. No docs needed. No tutorials.

Just patience and pattern recognition.

## 🧠 What I Learned

1. **Most bugs are simpler than they feel.**  
   We overcomplicate them because we panic. But once you slow down, the root usually reveals itself.

2. **Reading your own code is a skill.**  
   And the more you debug manually, the more fluent you become in the codebase you’ve written.

3. **Memory builds through effort.**  
   I haven’t forgotten that `useEffect` pitfall. But if I had just pasted in a StackOverflow fix? It probably wouldn’t have stuck.

4. **Confidence compounds.**  
   Solving a problem without Google might take longer at first — but it grows your confidence in ways no shortcut can.

## 🛠 When to Use Google (and When Not To)

Use it when:

- You need API docs or syntax references
- You hit a tool-specific bug with limited context
- You’re stuck after doing a thorough self-check

Avoid it when:

- You haven’t even read your own error logs
- You’re guessing more than investigating
- You’re just looking for the “quick fix” and ignoring the why

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

You don’t need to swear off Google.  
It’s an incredible tool — and it’s part of the dev journey.

But every now and then, challenge yourself:  
> *Can I fix this with what I already know?*

The more you trust your brain before your browser, the more you’ll realize:  
You know more than you think you do.

## 🧠 May 1, 2025 – Back to Terminal Mode

New month. New mindset. Same mission.

After a short pause, I’m picking my pen (keyboard?) back up — not because I have everything figured out, but because I want to stay intentional about the path I’m walking.

This morning felt different. Not because of some grand breakthrough, but because I chose to start — even when I didn’t feel “ready.” That’s the shift I’m leaning into: showing up anyway.

### ⚙️ Today’s Focus

- Finalizing torque values for build checklists  
- Updating deviation assignments and disposition automation  
- Cleaning up local dev folders post-reset  
- A little frontend practice in Astro — slow but steady  

### 💡 Thought of the Day

> **“You don't have to get it perfect — you just have to keep getting back up.”**

Progress isn't about always moving fast — it's about staying in motion. And today, I’m in motion again.

Let’s keep this streak going, one line, one log, one lesson at a time.

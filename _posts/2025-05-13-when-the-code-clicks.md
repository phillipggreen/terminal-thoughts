Every dev remembers *the moment* — that line of code, that bug fix, that thing you thought was impossible… until suddenly, it wasn’t.

I had one of those moments again last week. It wasn’t flashy. No major release. No dramatic transformation.

It was one line.

One function finally doing what I needed it to do.  
One small piece falling into place.  
And with it, something even better:  
> **Confidence.**

## 💡 Learning Isn’t a Straight Line

When you're learning to code, it can feel like you’re constantly behind.  
Too many docs. Too many options. Too many people posting wins while you’re just trying to *make the thing work*.

But here’s the truth I keep rediscovering:  
> Progress hides in the small wins.

- When your mental model finally matches the code output  
- When async logic clicks and stops feeling like magic  
- When you fix something *without* Googling  
- When you read your own code and it actually makes sense

Those moments are gold.  
They build the kind of quiet, grounded confidence that lasts longer than any tutorial high.

## 🛠 My Recent Win

I was refactoring part of my Pokémon Companion App — tweaking the local storage logic to persist team data across sessions. Simple in theory, but something kept breaking.

I debugged.  
I console.logged.  
I walked away.  
I came back.

And then it hit me — a missing `useEffect` dependency, buried under what looked like "working" code.

Once I fixed it, the state synced perfectly.  
And I just sat there smiling like I’d discovered fire.

No one else saw it.  
But I *felt* it.

And that’s the moment that keeps me going.

## 🔁 Stack Wins, Build Confidence

Confidence in coding doesn’t come from giant leaps. It comes from stacking dozens of these tiny moments until one day you realize:

- You’re not stuck as often.
- You know where to look when something breaks.
- You trust yourself a little more.

That’s the real growth.  
Not perfection — *resilience*.

## 🧵 Wrapping Up

If you’re deep in the dev fog right now — confused, tired, doubting — hang on.

Your next “aha” is coming.  
And when it hits, you’ll feel it.

Celebrate that.  
Write it down.  
Build on it.

Because those moments?  
They don’t just teach you how to code.

They teach you that you can.

*What was the last time something finally “clicked” for you in code? Share it — I’d love to celebrate with you.*

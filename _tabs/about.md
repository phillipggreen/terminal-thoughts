Hey, I'm **Phillip Green** — dev dad, builder of cool things, lifelong learner, and creator of Terminal Thoughts.

### 👨‍💻 What I Do
I'm a developer with a passion for coding, creating, and growing. While I'm currently studying Computer Science in school, I've also taught myself several programming languages and tools along the way. I build websites, write guides, explore new tech, and dive deep into the craft of software development.

Whether it's crafting a theme, spinning up a new project, or teaching what I've learned — I stay hands-on and curious.

### 🧠 Why This Blog
This blog is my digital terminal — a space where I can:
- Log my dev journey
- Share insights and mistakes
- Write to think
- Learn in public

It's not just a portfolio. It's a living notebook.

### 💻 What I Use
I’m a fan of clean tooling and minimal setups:
- VS Code with custom CyberDev theme
- GitHub for version control and open sharing
- Chirpy theme + Jekyll for this blog

### 🌱 Beyond the Code
When I’m not coding, I’m spending time with my wife and kids, playing Pokémon, reading the Bible, or brainstorming the next project. I believe in growth, gratitude, and building things that matter.
